        <img src="https://thecalmchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pheasant-Buckwheat-Noodle-1536x1086.jpg" alt="Pheasant Buckwheat Knife-cut Noodle" class="image">
        <p>Pheasant Buckwheat Knife-cut Noodle or Kkwong Maemil Kalguksu (꿩메밀칼국수) is a dish that reflects the local food culture of Jeju. Because chickens were rare, so the broth is made with pheasants caught at the foot of the mountains. Rice was scarce because it was impossible to farm due to the extreme weather and the type of soil on the island. Staple food like carbohydrates was made with buckwheat and is added to noodles, rice cakes and sujebi (Korean Mee Hoon Kueh). Eating pheasant buckwheat kalguksu is like studying the culinary history of Jeju island.</p>
